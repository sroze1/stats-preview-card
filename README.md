# stats-preview-card
**- 'Card' layout design, showing stats for a business regarding clients served and effectiveness. **
-  This is a challenge taken from Frontend Mentor
-  This exercise aims to develop basic understanding of responsive designs using media queries where appropriate. 
-  The 2 different sizes used will be to adapt for a desktop display and also a mobile display.
-  The display will utilise 'order' features in the grid to adapt for desktop display.
-  Images used are provided from the 'starter' filed from Frontend Mentor, and the final product will accurately reflect the images given as reference by the creators of the challenge
-  The color scheme is also pre-determined by the creators of the challenge, and the values were initially provided to replicate the example designs.

_The display layout will be set to grid, as it is deemed an appropriate option for this._
